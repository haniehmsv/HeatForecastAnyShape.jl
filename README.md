# HeatForecastAnyShape.jl


This repository presents a comprehensive solution to the inverse problem involving the steady-state heat equation with heat sources. Having the temperature measurements, this code leverages Bayesian inference to estimate the location, strength and the coeeficients of Fourier series for shape representation of heaters with any shape in the domain.
